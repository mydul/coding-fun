### Project Goals

To know the core concepts of Coding from a learning perspective. It allows you to create and build things using a computer, whether it's a simple program or a complex website. Coding involves writing instructions in a programming language that the computer can understand and execute. This process can be challenging at times, but it can also be very rewarding when you see your code come to life and do what you intended it to do.

One of the great things about coding is that there are so many different ways to approach a problem, and there are always new things to learn and discover. Whether you're just starting out or you're an experienced coder, there's always something new to learn and new ways to improve your skills.

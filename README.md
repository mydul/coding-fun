Coding can be a lot of fun!

## Project Title

Mainly, the Project title will be **"Making Virus"**.

### Project Goals

To know the core concepts of coding or programming from a fun. Especially for school kids learning perspective. It allows you to create and build things using a computer, whether it's a simple program or a complex website. Coding involves writing instructions in a programming language that the computer can understand and execute. This process can be challenging at times, but it can also be very rewarding when you see your code come to life and do what you intended it to do.

One of the great things about coding is that there are so many different ways to approach a problem, and there are always new things to learn and discover. Whether you're just starting out or you're an experienced coder, there's always something new to learn and new ways to improve your skills.

Coding can be a great hobby or career path, and it's a skill that is in high demand in today's tech-driven world. It can be a fun and exciting way to express your creativity and make a positive impact on the world.

### Project Details

VBScript MsgBox Function: The MsgBox function displays a message box and waits for the user to click a button and then an action is performed based on the button clicked by the user.

To display message boxes in VBScript you have to use the Msgbox function, if you want to display the Yes or No buttons you need to pass additional parameters to the function.

Today we are going to write "Do Loops in VbScript"; which loops or repeats something until a condition is satisfied.

## Demo

Source Code:

```python

do
msg1 = msgbox("Virus Alert! Click OK to close the application. But you Can't ;) ",o,"System Error by Mydul!")
LOOP

```

Output:

 ![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13613236/209034083-d1026d59-0082-4f7e-8b2f-42aabbad6ac9.png)



## Instructions
- Create a **.txt** file on **Notepad**, name it.
- Copy the source code. You can write whatever you want in between those quotation marks! Those will be shown in on PopUp window.
- Save it. And rename the file with **.vbs** extension.
- Run
- What happened? You can't close the Popup window or Error message by clicking OK or anyway; right?

                                                **It's FUN!! Ha Ha**

- Don't worry! You have another way to close the Popup window :)
- Right click on **Start (button)**
- Click on **Task Manager**
- Right click on **wscript.exe** in **Process tab**
- Click on **End task**
- Done! Happy ?

The fun part is you already learned how to create a "VBScript MsgBox Function" in two lines of code and how to turn it or off it. But not everyone knows anymore.

So, if you put that VBS file on someone's computer and they click it, they will be blown away. The fear of the VIRUS they will be in tension.

## Desclimer!

No harmful things are implied. Especially to educate school kids learning purposes can be used in such a way.
